# PyTSH
## By Darsheel Rath
PyTSH is a Terminal that is fixed in one directory. To use, copy the installer file to the directory you want it to be in, then run the terminal command to execute the file. You can also run it in Visual Studio Code, and possibly Cursor.
If you want to just make a fork or clone, take the whole repo or install in a fork folder.
